# students-manager-app
App, written in React with Redux, for managing students in a class.
All the data should be stored in a DB. Since we are not going to develop a real DB, use
https://jsonbin.io/ (you will need to open a new free account for that). A list of pages in the app:
List of students
● Each student has a first name, last name, age and birthday date.
● There should be buttons for adding a student, deleting a student, and edit student
details.
List of test grades
● Each row in the table will represent a test and should have: student name, profession,
date of the test and grade.
● There should be buttons for adding a test grade, deleting a test grade, and edit a test
grade.
● When adding a new grade, the student name field should be a drop down with all the
student's name from the “List of students” section in your app.
